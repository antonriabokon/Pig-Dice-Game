## 🐷 Pig(Dice) Game

Players take turns rolling a single die, trying to rack up points—but with a risky twist:

🎲 Roll a 1: Your turn immediately ends, and you score zero points for that round.

🎯 Roll 2–6: Add the number to your current turn total and decide whether to roll again or stop.

✋ Hold: If you stop (hold), the points from your current turn are added to your overall score. Then the next player takes their turn.

The first player to reach 100 points or more is crowned the winner.

Example Play

Lea starts the game and rolls a 5. She could hold and bank 5 points, but dares to roll again, getting a 2—her turn total is now 7. Lea rolls once more and hits a 1, losing the 7 points and ending her turn with 0.

Next, Frank rolls 4, 5, 3, 5, 6, then wisely decides to hold. He adds 23 points to his overall score.
